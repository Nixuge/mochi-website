## Arguments

Optional: a DiscoverListingsRequest object, which contains a listingId and a Page.

This object is used if you want to have a "view more" button on top of a block of anime.

listingId will be the id of the listing, while page will be the id of the paging object.

## Return value

This function returns an array of DiscoverListings.

A discoverListing object is an object that represents a block of shows on the homepage of your module.

It's usually used for latest releases or features/popular shows. Basically everything that's on a source's homepage.

It has the following properties:

- id: an ID for the discoverListing.
- title: self explanatory.
- type: a DiscoverListingType enum value (default, rank, featured)
  > Featured makes a big slider, default makes a small slider, rank makes a ranking section
- orientation: a DiscoverListingOrientationType enum value (portrait or landscape, the orientation of the posterImage)
- paging: a `Paging<Playlist>` object

### Paging

The paging structure is EXACTLY the same as what you'd find in search(). Please refer to that page if you need some info about it.

Note that the paging's page can be used in the DiscoverListingsRequest argument (see #arguments at the top)

## Examples

### Input:

```ts
console.log(listingRequest);
// *undefined*

console.log(listingRequest.listingId);
// latest-releases
console.log(listingRequest.listingId);
// featured

console.log(listingRequest.page);
// 1
console.log(listingRequest.page);
// 5
```

### Output:

```ts
return [
  {
    id: 'featured',
    title: 'Featured',
    type: DiscoverListingType.featured,
    orientation: DiscoverListingOrientationType.landscape,
    paging: `SEE #search`,
  },
  {
    id: 'latest',
    title: 'Latest Releases',
    type: DiscoverListingType.default,
    orientation: DiscoverListingOrientationType.landscape,
    paging: `SEE #search`,
  },
];
```

```ts
// Note: while this'll obviously show nothing, your module will still be usable.
// It's common to release a beta module that just returns [] without any logic if you already have the rest implemented.
return [];
```
