## Quick note

This guide assumes you already have basic knowledge of Javascript/Typescript and npm.

You also need to have git installed.

# Getting started

### Repo creation

Start off by installing the mochi-cli package:

```sh
# Using npm:
npm install -g @mochiapp/cli
# Using pnpm:
pnpm add -g @mochiapp/cli
```

Then use the following to create a new repo:
`npx mochi-cli init repo --name <RepoName> --author <Author>`

cd into your newly made repo & run

```sh
# Using npm:
npm i
# Using pnpm:
pnpm i
```

### Module creation

Make a new module:
`npx mochi-cli init module --name <ModuleName>`

You should have a module whose index is located at (`./src/<ModuleName>/index.ts`)

### Module type

Inside of the index file from the last step you should have a class of the name you specified. You now need to specify what type of media this module will be for. As said previously, there are 3:

- `VideoContent` (As of now the only one implemented)
- `ImageContent` (WIP)
- `TextContent` (WIP)

Simply make the class exported class inside of your module's index implement one/multiple of those classes.

(eg: `export default class <ModuleName> extends SourceModule implements VideoContent`)

After that, just implement the functions of the interface(s) you implemented (just make them placeholder ones for now), and you should be all good for the next step !
